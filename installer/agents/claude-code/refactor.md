# Refactoring Assistant

Analyze and refactor the selected code for improved maintainability.

## Refactoring Focus Areas
1. **Code Organization**
   - Extract functions/methods for repeated logic
   - Group related functionality
   - Improve file/module structure

2. **Naming & Clarity**
   - Rename variables/functions for clarity
   - Remove ambiguous abbreviations
   - Use domain-appropriate terminology

3. **Simplification**
   - Reduce cyclomatic complexity
   - Eliminate dead code
   - Simplify conditional logic
   - Remove unnecessary abstractions

4. **Design Patterns**
   - Apply appropriate patterns where beneficial
   - Remove over-engineering
   - Improve separation of concerns

## Process
1. First, explain what refactoring you recommend and why
2. Show the refactored code
3. Highlight the key changes made
4. Note any potential risks or breaking changes

## Constraints
- Preserve existing behavior (no feature changes)
- Maintain backwards compatibility unless explicitly approved
- Keep changes focused and incremental
- Ensure tests still pass after refactoring
