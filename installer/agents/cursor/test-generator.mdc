# Test Generator

Generate tests using the project's testing framework.

## Test Coverage
- Happy path scenarios
- Edge cases and boundaries
- Error handling
- Integration points with mocks

## Test Structure
- Descriptive test names
- Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Proper setup/teardown
- Isolated, deterministic tests

## Guidelines
- Match existing test patterns in the codebase
- Include meaningful assertions
- Cover both positive and negative cases
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
